# :cloud: Angular Weather App

Weather app created to study the basics of Angular.

I tried to do with **Angular** what I do with **React**. These technologies do the same thing but work differently. Somethings are easy to do with React, but not so easy with Angular and vice-versa. I think learning Angular can help me to create better React apps (or maybe I'll switch to Angular in the future :thinking:).

## :book: What I Learned

- Angular CLI (create project, component, module, service...).
- Angular folder and file structure.
- Angular basic concepts (state, props, lifecycle, routing, dependency injection).
